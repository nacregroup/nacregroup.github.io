<h3>
    About Us
</h3>

<p>
NACRE is a non-for-profit organization dedicated to the betterment of educational opportunities available for children in rural China. Our mission is achieved through the efforts of our Volunteer Mentors, whose experiences and opportunities are valued as core priorities of NACRE’s program.
</p>

<p>
We currently offer a Volunteer Mentors Program which sees young adults travelling to Guiyang, China to provide English education to local primary school students.

<p>
Change is infinite, prismatic, nacreous. When an individual steps beyond their world into another’s reality, they become the catalyst, the change; their very own reality is indelibly transformed. This is the change NACRE envisions for all our volunteers and students.

<h5>
    Our Mission
</h5>

<p>
NACRE was founded upon a specific desire to foster intercultural learning opportunities for children in rural China. Our organization purports to provide a platform by which young people may inquire, learn and contribute firsthand to our greater vision of providing transformative opportunities for both rural Chinese children and local volunteers. Through our Volunteer Mentors Program, NACRE aims to integrate the broadening of disadvantaged students’ horizons with the provision of safe, supported volunteer programs for young Australians.

<h5>
    Our Vision
</h5>
<p>
    Our organization envisions to provide the means and ambition to actualize social change on a human, tangible scale. We believe every young person should have the opportunity to see a reality beyond their own, to share in one another’s differences and to ultimately discover their place and influence within the globalized world of today.
