<h3>
    Volunteer Mentors Program
</h3>

<p>
    Our 2017 Volunteer Mentors Program will take place during the summer holidays, from late November to early December. Volunteers will travel to Guiyang of Guizhou Province, where they will spend approximately three weeks teaching Year 6 students at a rural primary school.

<h5>
    Being A Volunteer Mentor
</h5>

<p>
    As a NACRE mentor, you will undertake the role of teacher and mentor to a class of Year 6 students in rural China for the duration of <b>three weeks</b>. During the school day, mentors will primarily be engaged by teaching English to students, however, in keeping with our greater mission, our program is equally dedicated to providing thorough opportunity for cultural exchange and learning.
</p>


<p>
    Participation of our Volunteer Mentors Program is open to any applicant above the age of 18, subject to an interview. No Chinese ability is required, as there will be interpreters on the team going to Guiyang.

    Benefits of Being A Mentor
</h5>

<p>
    Delivering a unique and unforgettable experience is central to our organisation’s goals. Our partner school is located in Guiyang, a location well-famed for its picturesque landscapes and vivid scenery. The natural beauty and rich cultural lifeblood of the city renders it a fascinating and exotic destination for individuals of any background. Travelling and working in small groups of 4-5 volunteers, you will be presented with every opportunity to engage with the local Chinese culture, language and people. NACRE hopes to see every volunteer build lasting, positive relationships during the course of their program; you will meet like-minded, passionate young people with whom you will share newfound friendships, memories and aspirations. Upon completion of your four-week placement, you will be awarded a certification of recognition.

    The teaching of our volunteers will enable students in Guiyang to receive a module of dedicated English education, paving the way for them to pursue possible further interest in learning English at a higher level. By providing them the opportunity to question and learn about the wider world, we hope to encourage more global-based thinking and education in Year 6 students, and enable them to exchange experiences with young adults from another cultural background. Nacre_School_2 Our volunteers will bring an entirely new perspective and attitude into their classrooms, and NACRE aims to instill curiosity and excitement into the childrens’ educational experience by harnessing this energy.
